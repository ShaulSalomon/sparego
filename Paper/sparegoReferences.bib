  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses global convexity in multiobjective combinatorial optimization: a phenomenon that has previously been studied and shown to exist in a number of single objective combinatorial problems. Global convexity can imply that local optima are concentrated in a very small region of the solution space when distance is measured according to the topology of a neighborhood function. Global convexity is therefore not an absolute characteristic of an optimization problem, but refers of the topology that has been induced in the solution space. Local search based heuristics can exploit global convexity by choosing neighborhood functions that tend to concentrate the search in these regions and it has been claimed that global convexity plays an important role in the recent successes of many metaheuristics.
This report generalizes and extends those investigations for the case where multiple objectives exist by analyzing several points where global convexity might play a role. This analysis builds on generating local optima for well known scalarizing functions, covering the entire set of weights. We study the heuristic concentration of local optima, the distance between local optima for different weights over the non-dominated frontier and the stability of local optima for small weight variations. If global convexity can be established over local areas of the non- dominated frontier, it must also be exploitable in new metaheuristics for MOCO optimization.
We consider the 2-OPT neighborhood function on a three objective traveling salesman problem and use both the weighted sums program and the augmented Tchebycheff program. The results indicate that there indeed exists global convexity and foresee the development of new local search heuristics for approximating the non-dominated frontier in MOCO.}

  Abstract                 = {We consider ParEGO, a well-known algorithm in
the Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (EMO) community,
and make improvements to the implementation itself and
to some of the underlying algorithm components. ParEGO is
a surrogate-based multiobjective optimization algorithm based
on the Kriging/DACE model, designed specifically for problems
with expensive evaluation functions. First described in 2006, it
has been successful in empirical comparison studies and realworld
applications (e.g., in water network design and iterative
experimentation) since its release, but its code relies on now
outdated matrix routines, which we here replace by more modern
libraries. The code is also ported to GPU for further acceleration.
We also add options to the ParEGO algorithm itself: Originally
limited to runs of up to about 250 function evaluations (due to
the heavy computational cost of some matrix operations on the
full search trace), we now include methods for discarding (or
‘forgetting’) selected previous search points. We find that the
pure implementation updates reproduce the performance of the
original ParEGO release across a suite of benchmark problems;
further, the algorithmic changes enable scaling up of ParEGO
runs (i.e., no. generations) without significant loss of accuracy of
the model in tests of up to 500 evaluations. The project’s code
is now available for use by the EMO community and its uptake
in applications with expensive functions is encouraged.}

SAW-ing technically belongs to the penalty function based approaches and amounts to modifying the penalty function during the search. We show that it has a twofold benefit. First, it proves to be rather insensitive to its technical parameters, thereby providing a general, problem independent way to handle constrained problems. Second, it leads to superior EA performance. In an extensive series of comparative experiments we show that the SAW-ing EA outperforms a powerful graph coloring heuristic algorithm, DSatur, on the hardest graph instances and has a linear scale-up behaviour.}

Although not exact in the mathematical sense, it has long been recognised that population-based multi-objective optimisation techniques for real-world applications are immensely valuable and versatile. These techniques are usually employed when exact optimisation methods are not easily applicable or simply when, due to sheer complexity, such techniques could potentially be very costly. Another advantage is that since a population of decision vectors is considered in each generation these algorithms are implicitly parallelisable and can generate an approximation of the entire Pareto front at each iteration. A critique of their capabilities is also provided.},

The results show that NSGA-II, a popular multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, performs well compared with random search, even within the restricted number of evaluations used. A significantly better performance (particularly, in the worst case) is, however, achieved on our test set by an algorithm proposed herein-ParEGO-which is an extension of the single-objective efficient global optimization (EGO) algorithm of Jones et al. ParEGO uses a design-of-experiments inspired initialization procedure and learns a Gaussian processes model of the search landscape, which is updated after every function evaluation. Overall, ParEGO exhibits a promising performance for multiobjective optimization problems where evaluations are expensive or otherwise restricted in number.},

We focus on the scenario of a limited budget of function evaluations (100 and 250), where previously it was found that an iterative optimization method — ParEGO — based on surrogate modeling of the multiobjective fitness landscape was very effective in the non-noisy case. Our investigation here measures how ParEGO degrades with increasing noise levels. Meanwhile we introduce a new method that we propose for limited-budget and noisy scenarios: TOMO, deriving from the single-objective PB1 algorithm, which iteratively seeks the basins of optima using nonparametric statistical testing over previously visited points. We find ParEGO tends to outperform TOMO, and both (but especially ParEGO), are quite robust to noise. TOMO is comparable and perhaps edges ParEGO in the case of budgets of 100 evaluations with low noise. Both usually beat our suite of five baseline comparisons.}

  Abstract                 = {In engineering and other ‘real-world’ applications, multiobjective optimization problems must frequently be tackled on a tight evaluation budget — tens or hundreds of function evaluations, rather than thousands. In this paper, we investigate two algorithms that use advanced initialization and search strategies to operate better under these conditions. The first algorithm, Bin_MSOPS, uses a binary search tree to divide up the decision space, and tries to sample from the largest empty regions near ‘fit’ solutions. The second algorithm, ParEGO, begins with solutions in a latin hypercube and updates a Gaussian processes surrogate model of the search landscape after every function evaluation, which it uses to estimate the solution of largest expected improvement. The two algorithms are tested using a benchmark suite of nine functions of two and three objectives — on a budget of only 250 function evaluations each, in total. Results indicate that the two algorithms search the space in very different ways and this can be used to understand performance differences. Both algorithms perform well but ParEGO comes out on top in seven of the nine test cases after 100 function evaluations, and on six after the first 250 evaluations.}

  Abstract                 = {Methods for generating Pareto optimal solutions to a multicriterion optimization problem are considered. The norm methods based on the scalarization of the original multicriterion problem by using the l p-norm are discussed in a unified form and a parametrization suitable for different interactive design systems is suggested. In addition, an alternative approach which, instead of scalarization, reduces the dimension of the multicriterion problem is proposed. This is called the partial weighting method and it can beinterpreted as a generalization of the traditional scalarization technique where the weighted sum of the criteria is used as the objective function. The first of these two approaches (norm method) is very flexible from a designer's point of view and it can be applied also in non-convex cases to the determination of the Pareto optimal set whereas the latter (partial weighting method) is especially suitable for problems where the number of criteria is large. Throughout the article several illustrative truss examples are presented to augment the scanty collection of multicriterion problems treated in the literature of optimum structural design.},

  Abstract                 = {Many scientific phenomena are now investigated by complex computer models or codes. A computer experiment is a number of runs of the code with various inputs. A feature of many computer experiments is that the output is deterministic--rerunning the code with the same inputs gives identical observations. Often, the codes are computationally expensive to run, and a common objective of an experiment is to fit a cheaper predictor of the output to the data. Our approach is to model the deterministic output as the realization of a stochastic process, thereby providing a statistical basis for designing experiments (choosing the inputs) for efficient prediction. With this model, estimates of uncertainty of predictions are also available. Recent work in this area is reviewed, a number of applications are discussed, and we demonstrate our methodology with an example. CR - Copyright \&\#169; 1989 Institute of Mathematical Statistics},
